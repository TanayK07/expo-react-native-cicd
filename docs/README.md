A powerful, automated CI/CD workflow for React Native and Expo applications. Build, test, and deploy your mobile apps with ease using GitHub Actions.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß™ **Automated Testing**: TypeScript checks, ESLint, and Prettier validation
- üì± **Multiple Build Types**: Development, Production APK, and Production AAB
- üîÑ **Flexible Triggers**: Manual workflow dispatch, push to main branch, or pull requests
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Storage Integration**: Automatic upload to your preferred cloud storage (Zoho Drive, Google Drive, etc.)
- üì¶ **Artifact Management**: GitHub-hosted build artifacts for easy access
- üõ†Ô∏è **Optimized Configuration**: Properly configured Metro bundler and EAS CLI
- üìã **Multiple Deployment Options**: GitHub Releases, cloud storage, or both

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

This repository contains **example workflow templates** in the `examples/` directory. These are not active workflows but rather templates that you can copy to your own project's `.github/workflows/` directory.

To use any of these workflows:

1. Choose the workflow that best fits your needs from the `examples/` directory
2. Create a `.github/workflows/` directory in your project if it doesn't exist
3. Copy the chosen workflow file (e.g., `generalized-workflow.yml`) into your `.github/workflows/` directory
4. Rename it if desired (e.g., to `react-native-cicd.yml`)
5. Configure the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository settings

The workflows will not run in this repository - they are provided as ready-to-use templates for your own projects.

## üìã Prerequisites

- React Native / Expo project
- GitHub repository
- [Expo account](https://expo.dev/) (for EAS builds)
- Cloud storage account (Zoho Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.) for build distribution (optional)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Add this workflow to your project

Copy the `.github/workflows/react-native-cicd.yml` file to your project.

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `EXPO_TOKEN`: Your Expo access token
- `CLOUD_STORAGE_TYPE`: Your cloud storage provider (e.g., "zoho", "drive", "dropbox")
- `CLOUD_STORAGE_TOKEN`: Authentication token for your cloud storage
- `CLOUD_STORAGE_ROOT_ID`: Root folder ID for your cloud storage

### 3. Customize the workflow (Optional)

Modify the workflow to match your project's requirements:

- Adjust build profiles in your `eas.json`
- Customize build output filenames
- Change test commands based on your project's setup

## üîß Usage

### Automatic Builds

Pushes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the workflow.

### Manual Builds

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Actions" tab
3. Select "React Native CI/CD" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Choose the build type: all, dev, prod-apk, or prod-aab
6. Click "Run workflow" button

## üß∞ Example Workflows

This repository includes several example workflows for different deployment scenarios:

1. **Generalized Workflow**: Cloud-agnostic storage integration (main workflow)
2. **GitHub Releases**: Create draft releases with artifacts and changelogs
3. **Zoho Drive Integration**: Specialized workflow for Zoho Drive storage

Check the [examples directory](./examples) for these workflow templates and instructions on how to use them.

## üß∞ EAS Configuration

Example `eas.json` file:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 12.5.3",
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
